Tyler Ellegard, Gradient Investments portfolio manager, joins Market Domination to discuss hit outlook for the second half of the year. Ellegard expresses cautious optimism, suggesting that ""good times could continue,"" but warns that the second half of the year will likely be ""choppy."" He advises investors to adopt a more diversified portfolio approach, cautioning against overreliance on large stocks such as Nvidia. Ellegard highlights energy, healthcare, and industrials as promising sectors for investment. However, he clarifies that this doesn't mean completely abandoning tech giants: ""That doesn't say that we're taking everything off the table from these mega-caps. We still like the Googles, we still like Meta (META), and we still like Amazon (AMZN). We still think there's room to run. But we may just be a little underweight on the Nvidias (NVDA), Microsofts (MSFT), and Apples (AAPL) right now"".

Victor Cossel, Seaport Research Partners senior macro and equity strategist, joins Market Domination to offer guidance on navigating this sector. Cossel reflects on the sector's journey, noting that software stocks faced negative sentiment early in the year. Many investors believed that ""AI would disintermediate"" numerous companies in this space. However, Cossel argues that this sentiment has been ""overdone,"" pointing to the continued strong performance of industry leaders like Salesforce (CRM) and Adobe (ADBE). Turning to market dynamics, Cossel highlights emerging trends: ""We're seeing a lot of familiar reversal patterns in software stocks."" He adds, ""It's the reversal formation that really caught our attention. The prior consolidation that... springboards to the upside.""

Imperial College Business School professor of economics Tommaso Valletti joins Catalysts to discuss Big Tech's regulation issues in the EU. Valletti notes that the European Commission tried to use antitrust laws to curb the market power of some Big Tech companies. However, that approach moved slowly, so they decided to regulate companies under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is a new policy that is designed to target companies identified as ""gatekeepers."" Meta was identified by the Commission as a ""gatekeeper"" and could be faced with fines for violating the Digital Markets Act in its advertising model. Companies charged under the Digital Markets Act may respond, which would kick off a regulatory dialog. Valletti says, ""I suspect that the stakes are so high because the philosophy of the European Commission is that they would like some Big Tech companies to change the business model. So in terms of Meta, it's about data collection. In terms of Apple (AAPL), they have an ecosystem which is completely closed and they want to have a revolution there. But these companies are making so much money that for them, it's better to fight on legal grounds instead of changing the business model."" He explains that fines for violating the act are more like a ""slap on the wrist"" compared to the revenue generation of Big Tech names like Apple, Meta, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL): ""Those fines don't really help at all if you want a certain conduct to be changed. And so you have to impose higher fines that DMA has the power to impose up to 10% of the global turnover. So actually this would be fines that hurt more. But then you have to go through courts to see whether this is going to happen or not. To me, it's more important, not that the fines are imposed, but the behavior of firms changes up-front because you don't want to fine people after they drive too fast. You want people to start slowing down."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

New home sales for the month of May fell over 11%, according to the US Census Bureau. KPMG senior economist Yelena Maleyev claims that it will be a while before the housing sector sees relief, only estimating one interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve by December: ""We've pushed that forecast out into December, so we do expect one rate cut in December, which will help bring overall mortgage rates to perhaps around 6.5 by the end of the year. That's probably not what people who are waiting for those 3% mortgage rates are wanting to hear, but unfortunately, those days are behind us."" She adds that a few more rate cuts in the pipeline could bring mortgage rates to 5.5%. US equity markets have hit record highs in 2024, largely spearheaded by the growth of semiconductor and chip stocks like Nvidia (NVDA). BlackRock US Head of Thematic and Active ETFs Jay Jacobs sits down with Brad Smith on Wealth! as part of Yahoo Finance's ETF Report to discuss several of BlackRock's notable iShares ETFs in relation to the growing AI landscape and the energy and digital infrastructure demands that come with mass adoption. The number of US households with direct stock ownership increased by 6% between 2019 and 2022, according to a Federal Reserve study of consumer finances. JPMorgan Wealth Management head of self-directed investing Andrea Finan says her biggest tip for beginner investors is to ""find the experts ... Go to credentialized places to get information and learn. I really strive for people to become curious in investing and learn and use the tools..."" Finally, as more than 24 million people are expected to fly out of US airports during the 4th of July weekend, Hopper Lead Economist Hayley Berg gives an overview of thee busy weekend ahead. She explains that summer travel prices have decreased, as airfares are down 18% in the US and hotel and rental car prices remain in line with previous years: ""So those travelers who are getting away are definitely able to expand those travel budgets into things like activities and maybe some nice dinners out rather than spending as much on accommodations and flights.""
